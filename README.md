#ML MODEL
Used Car Sale Prediction (Binary Classification)
This machine learning model predicts whether a used car will be sold or not, using historical car sales data. It is designed as a binary classification task using the Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains records of used cars with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Brand	Car brand (e.g., Toyota, BMW)
Model	Car model
Year	Manufacturing year
Fuel_Type	Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)
Price	Listed price of the vehicle
KM_Driven	Total kilometers driven
Seller_Type	Dealer or Individual
Transmission	Manual or Automatic
Owner_Type	First/Second Owner etc.
Color	Color of the vehicle
Location	Sale location
Sold	Target – whether the car was sold (Yes/No)

🎯 Problem Statement
Predict whether a listed used car will be sold (Sold = Yes) or not (Sold = No) based on the given features.

🧠 Model Used
We used a Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters. This method helps avoid overfitting while improving prediction accuracy.

⚙️ Steps Followed
Data Cleaning

Removed symbols like ₹ and , from Price and KM_Driven.

Converted string values to numeric format.

Handled missing values.

Feature Engineering

Label encoded categorical variables like Brand, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, etc.

Selected relevant features based on domain knowledge.

Model Training

Split data into training and test sets (80/20 split).

Used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters:

Edit
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2],
    'bootstrap': [True, False]
}
Model Evaluation

Evaluated with Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.

Achieved high accuracy due to parameter tuning and feature optimization.

Interpretability

Visualized feature importance to understand which variables impact the prediction the most.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: [X.XX]% (replace with your actual accuracy)

Precision/Recall/F1-score: Evaluated for both Sold/Not Sold classes.

Confusion Matrix: Visualized to understand TP, FP, FN, TN.

🔍 Feature Importance Example
Feature	Importance
Price	High
KM_Driven	High
Year	Moderate
Brand	Moderate
Seller_Type	Lower

🧪 Future Improvements
Try advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM

Add interaction terms (e.g., Brand × Year)

Handle class imbalance if present

Integrate with a web app using Streamlit or Flask
